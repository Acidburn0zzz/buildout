Silva 3.0 issues
================

General comments
----------------

- When in a tab and you want to reload it (just to be sure it's up to
  date) you go to the selected tab, hover, your cursor turns to a
  pointer so it's obviously a link, you click, and nothing
  happens. However sometimes, when in a subscreen like "View previous
  version", the link does work and it's the only way to get back to
  the main screen. Best would be if the link always worked. Second
  best is that the tab ceases to be a link when selected, but then you
  have to go to another tab and back to get a reload.

- Changing languages does not change the UI. The user must reload. Can
  we do that for the user?

Login
=====

- Logout and in: after clicking the logout button the browser goes to:
  http://next30.infrae.com/service_members/logout or
  http://preprod30.infrae.com/service_members/logout
  If I want to login again immediately it's not possible to login and you can
  try as many times as you like. Is this a non-wsgi occurance? It was really
  confusing and needs to change.

Export screen
-------------
+ Error page:
  "You tried to export the content [Chief Editor] which contains the content
  [Roles and permissions] who have a reference to the content [Author – basic]
  which is not itself contained in the exported content. ."
  to:
  "Sorry, you tried to export the content [Chief Editor]. This contains the content
  [Roles and permissions] which has a reference to the content [Author – basic]
  which is not itself contained in the exported content.
  Please go back using your browser's back button"

Functional fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Manage versions

- View: when viewing an old version the "Publish now" button in the
  header should not appear, as you're not publishing the version
  you're viewing. Change it to a "Return" button?
  Still a problem. Can we fix this?


UI/usability fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

+ When a document doesn't have a tile, it's id gets displayed instead. Thus one
  thinks the doc does have a title (albeit a lousy one). We need to display the
  string "no title" instead.

-----> This was the same behavior in the old Silva.
-----+ Well, in the Contents screen the old Silva displayed "no title".
-----+ I still see titles in Content that are the same as the id (when there
       is no title).

Submit buttons and reporting

+ When a doc is approved for the future, you can't see that it is
  approved for the future. The only indication is the "Publish Now"
  button changes to "Revoke Approval". No information about the future
  date of publication is visible. You only see "Manage versions". It's
  especially confusing if a doc is already published, then you see
  "Manaal close" and a "x Close published version" button, but nothing
  about the approval:
  (http://next30.infrae.com/edit#publish!products/lxml). We can
  display the future approval date in the "Information", but I'd
  rather see it in the form body itself because that's where users
  will be looking, and they can change it if needed.

Manage versions

- View: when viewing an old version there's no obvious way to get back
  the publish screen. We can let people learn to click on the already
  selected tab, but that's not obvious. Let's replace the workflow-action
  button (which appears under the item icon/title) with a "Back" button.
  We need to get rid of the "New version"/"Revoke..."/"Publish" action
  button when viewing an old version anyway.
  [However this is not optimal because we're mixing actions with navigation.
  Any better ideas? Deselect the Publish tab and select the Preview button?]

Logged in as Author
===================

Publish screen of docs
----------------------

Publication time

- Strangely, if I enter '11' into the year field as an Author, the
  value is accepted and becomes 2011. This fails when an Editor
  publishes.

Logged in as ChiefEditor
========================

Publish screen of docs
----------------------

- When an Editor goes to the Publish screen of a doc that's been
  submitted for approval, it's not really obvious that the doc is
  waiting for approval. The only indication is there's both a "Publish
  Now" and "Reject Request" button (looking good together). We need to
  say something, "This document is pending approval for publication.".

Silva News Network
==================

- The month field lets me fill in '19'. Can the inline validation do a
  range check like it does in publish?

- After submitting the above entry, the entire multi-field goes pink,
  and I have no idea which of the seven subfields contains the error. We
  need to figure out something here. We know what the invalid entry is,
  right? Can we display the field's name?

External Sources
================

+ When editing a table cell with only an image in it, you can't alter cell properties
  and cell content. Example:
  http://infrae.com/st/edit#content!silva_docs_trunk/getting_started/navigation
  It is not possible to add or alter the cell content and properties on the cell
  with the image icon.

- When adding a DateTimeField, LinkField, and probably other type of
  field as well they don't get correctly rendered in the Code Source add
  form in the editor.

- When editing an External Source in the editor, the source edit form doesn't
  display the title of the source, so you have no idea which Code/SQP/CSV
  source you're editing. Please make the title display at the top of the form.

+ It's not possible to tab between fields in the External Source Settings form.
  Somehow we have to fix this usability problem.

CKEditor
========

+ When you add an image in CKEditor, you usually add the image on an empty
  line. When done adding, it looks fine. After saving, the editor inserts an
  extra p with a nbsp above the image. You always have to remove this p after
  saving. Annoying. Same goes for Code Sources.

SMI Sidebar
===========
+ The sidebar navigation should use short titles. So instead of "The Silva
  Content Management System" it should just read "Silva".

UI
==

Spelling
--------

Image properties Link tab has option 'Link to an another item.'
