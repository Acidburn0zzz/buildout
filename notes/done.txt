Document
--------

- (You cannot remove the title from the document editor. Should this be possible ?)
  [Let's keep it this way. The only way to remove the title is in properties.]

+ How do we call a document without its title? Looks like @@content.html gets
  the title and the body, but sometimes users call the title elsewhere, higher
  up in the layout template, and they only want the body. Seems like this is a
  problem with news items too. @@body.html ?

   version document/get_viewable
   details version/@@details
   details/get_text
   details/get_introduction
   details/get_thumbnail

  > We can even add an get_title. If yes move point to testing.txt, If
    no delete it.
