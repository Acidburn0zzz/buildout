Testing
=======

Those issues comes from the testing.txt file.

+ The "Request approval history" table in the Publish screen of a doc needs
  attention, e.g.:
  http://preprod30.infrae.com/edit#publish!lobby/testors/codesourceadd
  @Sanne: Looks like we need clear:both or something with the floats. In order
  to fix this you'll need to login as an Author. You can use Torvald's account.
  @Sylvain: Please move this table down so it appears just above the "Manage
  versions" table. Right now the "Publish closed version" table is underneath,
  and "Request approval history" could be a long table.

- Delete: When selecting items for deletion, the form remains sticky
  with selections after deletion, e.g. if you delete versions 2 and 3,
  the form comes back with items 0 and 1 selected.

- Delete: We don't ask, "Are you sure?" on the delete action. Should we?

Manual close

- Under "Manual close", the hint should have the same font-style as
  the field hints. The selector is '.form-head p'. Currently hints are
  in italic (which should change because it doesn't make sense, but
  let's first be consistent).

- Vertical space under "Manual close" between hint and button needs to
  collapse and match the spacing between hints and fields.


+ In a document on infrae.com going to the Customization or Subscriptions
  screen throws an error.
