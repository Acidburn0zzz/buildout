============================
Those issues should be fixed
============================

Testing
=======

Those issues comes from the testing.txt file.

Is there a more efficient way to do this?
I guess you can't combine defines and gets: feeder/get_viewable/details/get_text

-----> It is way faster yes. That would be too easy. And I fixed you
       code so it doesn't fail if there is no published version, and
       works if it is a Ghost, and I moved in the Python file.

-----+ @Sylvain So, in terms of documenting this, the provider.search_document()
       API returns the body without title, yes?
       For the other things such as get_introduction, get_thumbnail and
       get_title we still need to define version and @@details, yes?

CKEditor
--------

= creating sub level lists using the tab doesn't work (FF and IE8). In
  IE8 the SMI green loading lights keep spinning when trying to indent a
  level so probably this is some JS issue.

  @Wim:
  RTFM: http://docs.cksource.com/CKEditor_3.x/Users_Guide/Rich_Text/Lists

+ version document/get_viewable
  details version/@@details
  details/get_text
  details/get_introduction
  details/get_thumbnail
  details version/@@details....

  > We can even add a get_title.

------> Now with a get_title method.
------+ Cool! This will be useful.


Reference dialog
----------------

- In the reference dialog clicking the icon of a non-container doesn't do
  anything. Make it trigger the same action as the 'plus' icon on the right.
  This obviates the need to move the mouse across the screen, which new
  users find confusing because the selection checkbox used to be on the left.
  """WB: Non of the icons reference the add action, only the '+' icon adds a
  reference."""

-------> If you click on the icon of a container, you go inside this
         container, in order to have the same behavior than the
         generic folder listing. This was discussed on the ML to have
         the same behavior.

-------> By so, clicking on the icon of a content doesn't select it,
         as it will be a different behavior for container and
         non-containers.

Usability
=========

Those issues comes from the usability.txt file.

== portlet ==

- when there's multiple H4's in the portlet, it looks too crowded. And also when
  the title is longer than one line, it does not look good. The H4's in the
  portlet can be different from the ones in the form-content.
    = The H4's in the portlet are now underlined, without border and
      background color (see below)
    +

== dialog boxes ==

+ the 'upload' dialog box displays a scroll bar. The box now has a width of
  300px (inline styling). Changing the width to 310px will fix it.
- the buttons in dialog boxes look different from the others. I think all
  buttons should look the same.
    = buttons in dialog boxes are bigger, have more padding, to make
      easier click targets.
