Those issues should be fixed
============================

Testing
=======

Those issues comes from the testing.txt file.

CKEditor
--------

= creating sub level lists using the tab doesn't work (FF and IE8). In
  IE8 the SMI green loading lights keep spinning when trying to indent a
  level so probably this is some JS issue.

  @Wim:
  RTFM: http://docs.cksource.com/CKEditor_3.x/Users_Guide/Rich_Text/Lists

Reference dialog
----------------

- In the reference dialog clicking the icon of a non-container doesn't do
  anything. Make it trigger the same action as the 'plus' icon on the right.
  This obviates the need to move the mouse across the screen, which new
  users find confusing because the selection checkbox used to be on the left.
  """WB: Non of the icons reference the add action, only the '+' icon adds a
  reference."""

-------> If you click on the icon of a container, you go inside this
         container, in order to have the same behavior than the
         generic folder listing. This was discussed on the ML to have
         the same behavior.

-------> By so, clicking on the icon of a content doesn't select it,
         as it will be a different behavior for container and
         non-containers.

Usability
=========

Those issues comes from the usability.txt file.

== portlet ==

- when there's multiple H4's in the portlet, it looks too crowded. And also when
  the title is longer than one line, it does not look good. The H4's in the
  portlet can be different from the ones in the form-content.
    = The H4's in the portlet are now underlined, without border and
      background color (see below)
