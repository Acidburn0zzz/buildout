============================
Those issues should be fixed
============================

Testing
=======

Those issues comes from the testing.txt file.

Is there a more efficient way to do this?
I guess you can't combine defines and gets: feeder/get_viewable/details/get_text

-----> It is way faster yes. That would be too easy. And I fixed you
       code so it doesn't fail if there is no published version, and
       works if it is a Ghost, and I moved in the Python file.

CKEditor
--------

= creating sub level lists using the tab doesn't work (FF and IE8). In
  IE8 the SMI green loading lights keep spinning when trying to indent a
  level so probably this is some JS issue.

Saving for Wim:
RTFM: http://docs.cksource.com/CKEditor_3.x/Users_Guide/Rich_Text/Lists

Publish tab
-----------

- Personally I miss the link colors for Unapproved, Published, and
  Last closed. They made it so clear and you could instantly see what
  was what. Now you have to read each one. We do have room to put
  colored balls next to the version number but they won't look good.

Reference dialog
----------------

- In the reference dialog clicking the icon of a non-container doesn't do
  anything. Make it trigger the same action as the 'plus' icon on the right.
  This obviates the need to move the mouse across the screen, which new
  users find confusing because the selection checkbox used to be on the left.
  """WB: Non of the icons reference the add action, only the '+' icon adds a
  reference."""

-------> If you click on the icon of a container, you go inside this
         container, in order to have the same behavior than the
         generic folder listing. This was discussed on the ML to have
         the same behavior.

-------> By so, clicking on the icon of a content doesn't select it,
         as it will be a different behavior for container ans
         non-containers.


Usability
=========

Those issues comes from the usability.txt file.

== general UI ==

+ non-editable fields are now skipped when using tab. However, they are still
  focused when selected.

== portlet ==

- when there's multiple H4's in the portlet, it looks too crowded. And also when
  the title is longer than one line, it does not look good. The H4's in the
  portlet can be different from the ones in the form-content.
    = The H4's in the portlet are now underlined, without border and
      background color (see below)

== dialog boxes ==

+ the 'upload' dialog box displays a scroll bar. The box now has a width of
  300px (inline styling). Changing the width to 310px will fix it.
- the buttons in dialog boxes look different from the others. I think all
  buttons should look the same.
    = buttons in dialog boxes are bigger, have more padding, to make
      easier click targets.


Login form
----------
- This is the form that appears when you leave an SMI window open overnight and
  try to do something.
  + The required marker should be float:right so it's close to the field.
    = done
  + The Cancel and Login buttons are small, should have more padding to make
    easier click targets.
    = done
  + After login, a modal dialogue appears with a Continue button that should
    be larger too.
    = done


Properties screen
-----------------
+ On focus, the field element texts darken. Make that happen on hover too.
  Sometimes I focus a field just to read the gray acquired metadata better.
    = done
- The textareas need a little padding (2px?), they look cramped.
  http://preprod30.infrae.com/edit#properties!/
    = done
- The Acquirable and Acquired Value markers don't line up perfectly. See a
  published document.
    = fixed
+ The "acquirable" marker is not long enough.
    = fixed by capitalizing letters
+ In the Acquirable and Acquired Value markers, since the letters are all caps,
  they sit a little high.
  Actually, why are these 'uppercase'? If you make them 'capitalize', everything
  fits! :)
    = letters are now capitalized

To Fix
======

+ An h4 in the information portlet has both a border and an underline. The
  underline can go, the border is enough text-decoration. Maybe those h4s should
  have a bg color? Maybe not....
  http://preprod30.infrae.com/edit#content!lobby/testors/silva400.png
    = h4 is underlined (see above)

- Do we need a little more space between the forms? See the forms in the above
  example. Say, 30px?
    = I've changed it to 25px
