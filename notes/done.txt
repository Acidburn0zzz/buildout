Document
--------


+ How do we call a document without its title? Looks like @@content.html gets
  the title and the body, but sometimes users call the title elsewhere, higher
  up in the layout template, and they only want the body. Seems like this is a
  problem with news items too. @@body.html ?

   version document/get_viewable
   details version/@@details
   details/get_text
   details/get_introduction
   details/get_thumbnail

  > We can even add an get_title. If yes move point to testing.txt, If
    no delete it.


Subscriptions screen
--------------------

++ Subscriptions don't seem to send mail

   > This have nothing to do with Silva. Maildrophost is now running
     and sending emails.

Fixed:
++ The rendering of Events is funky, seems to use get_intro but there's a year
  in there and the title has a nested strong tag. Search for EuroPython to see
  it.
