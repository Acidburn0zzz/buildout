  = Aha, it was a creative! Figures. Well, it's gone now.


Document
--------

- How do we call a document without its title? Looks like @@content.html gets
  the title and the body, but sometimes users call the title elsewhere, higher
  up in the layout template, and they only want the body. Seems like this is a
  problem with news items too. @@body.html ?

   version document/get_viewable
   details version/@@details
   details/get_text
   details/get_introduction
   details/get_thumbnail

This is great. So I changed the code from:

  <tal:tweet tal:define="feeder provider.search('twitterfeeder')"
    tal:condition="feeder is not None">
    <tal:embed tal:replace="structure path:feeder/@@content.html">
      latest tweet
    </tal:embed>
  </tal:tweet>

to:

  <tal:tweet tal:define="feeder provider.search('twitterfeeder')"
    tal:condition="feeder is not None">
    <tal:embed
      tal:define="
        version path:feeder/get_viewable;
        details path:version/@@details"
      tal:replace="structure path:details/get_text">
      latest tweet
    </tal:embed>
  </tal:tweet>

Is there a more efficient way to do this?
I guess you can't combine defines and gets: feeder/get_viewable/details/get_text
