Those issues should be fixed

Testing
=======

Those issues comes from the testing.txt file.

Is there a more efficient way to do this?
I guess you can't combine defines and gets: feeder/get_viewable/details/get_text

-----> It is way faster yes. That would be too easy. And I fixed you
       code so it doesn't fail if there is no published version, and
       works if it is a Ghost, and I moved in the Python file.

CKEditor
--------

= creating sub level lists using the tab doesn't work (FF and IE8). In
  IE8 the SMI green loading lights keep spinning when trying to indent a
  level so probably this is some JS issue.
