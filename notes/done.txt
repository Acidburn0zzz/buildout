Those issues should be fixed
============================

Testing
=======

Those issues comes from the testing.txt file.

Is there a more efficient way to do this?
I guess you can't combine defines and gets: feeder/get_viewable/details/get_text

-----> It is way faster yes. That would be too easy. And I fixed you
       code so it doesn't fail if there is no published version, and
       works if it is a Ghost, and I moved in the Python file.

CKEditor
--------

= creating sub level lists using the tab doesn't work (FF and IE8). In
  IE8 the SMI green loading lights keep spinning when trying to indent a
  level so probably this is some JS issue.

Saving for Wim:
RTFM: http://docs.cksource.com/CKEditor_3.x/Users_Guide/Rich_Text/Lists

Publish tab
-----------

- Personally I miss the link colors for Unapproved, Published, and
  Last closed. They made it so clear and you could instantly see what
  was what. Now you have to read each one. We do have room to put
  colored balls next to the version number but they won't look good.

Reference dialog
----------------

- In the reference dialog clicking the icon of a non-container doesn't do
  anything. Make it trigger the same action as the 'plus' icon on the right.
  This obviates the need to move the mouse across the screen, which new
  users find confusing because the selection checkbox used to be on the left.
  """WB: Non of the icons reference the add action, only the '+' icon adds a
  reference."""

-------> If you click on the icon of a container, you go inside this
         container, in order to have the same behavior than the
         generic folder listing. This was discussed on the ML to have
         the same behavior.

-------> By so, clicking on the icon of a content doesn't select it,
         as it will be a different behavior for container ans
         non-containers.
