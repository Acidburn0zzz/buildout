Those issues should be fixed, or I didn't understood them

Zope
----

- The logo upload widget in /service_ui/manage_settings is
  buggy. Sylvain said he'll replace it with another.

+ I cannot cut and paste code sources. Tried to move cs_flash_source
  and cs_googlemaps down a level but I get a login prompt. I think this
  is recent.

+ Is this the correct doctype declaration? We're doing html5:
  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">

  > Fix in the SMI template.

++ This returns a 404.

† We have to support these URL schemes: tel, itms, webcal. Someday we'll need a
  service for this, especially as we do more mobile sites, but for now a text
  list will suffice.

  Here's a test page:

Document
-------

+ If a document doesn't have a title, an empty h1 tag gets rendered. This
  is semantically bad and means you need display:none hacks in the css.

- The document title seems to have a one-way connection to the metadata title.
  If you edit the metadata title it doesn't show up in the document (yet it's
  used in the SMI listing). However if you edit the title in the document, that
  overwrites the metadata title.

(You cannot remove the title from the document editor. Should this be possible ?)

+ When upgrading from previous Silvas can we bump up the heading size? So an h3
  becomes h2, etc.

+ Bug: when an 'illegal' char is entered into certain Code Source fields, the
  source becomes un-editable, e.g. try entering 'ünâligned' into the css style
  field of a Portlet Element code source. This is new. The source/page saves,
  publishes, and renders just fine, but when you try to edit the source you get
  a js error:
  "An unexpected error happened on the server while retrieving Code source
  parameters. The Code Source might be buggy."
  http://preprod30.infrae.com/edit#content!lobby/testors/univalue
  http://infrae.com/lobby/testors/univalue/edit/tab_edit
  The only solution is to delete the whole source and make it again. But that's
  a pain and the Author may not know what went wrong in the first place. See the
  following bug....

++ When looking up an image, then adding one in the dailog, the add form has
  a bizarre layout. Must be missing some key classes for the new css.

++ When I click Save and Publish now, I get an alert:
  This document have been modified. If you continue you will loose thoses modifications. Do you want to continue?
  Slow browser, I know.
  Please change the text to:
  This document has been modified. If you continue you will lose these modifications. Do you want to continue?

++ Adding a tel link to an image works the first time but the next time you save
  it gets corrupted. This link:
  tel:+31102437051
  first worked but then became:
  http://preprod30.infrae.com/++preview++/lobby/testors/tel_links/
  after saving again.

  After saving, normal links get corrupted too. This was an external link going
  to http://firefox.co. But after saving it goes to, uh, model:
  http://preprod30.infrae.com/++preview++/lobby/testors/tel_links/

  So the problem with tel links may not exist, it's a problem with links on
  images in general.

++ The link on one of my images got transformed to a local anchor. Don't know
  how, or what it was, but it wasn't a local anchor.

- When images are rendered, they're missing their height and width
  attributes, which makes pages perceptually slow.

+ How do we call a document without its title? Looks like @@content.html gets
  the title and the body, but sometimes users call the title elsewhere, higher
  up in the layout template, and they only want the body. Seems like this is a
  problem with news items too. @@body.html ?

  > version document/get_viewable
  > details version/@@details
  > details/get_text
  > details/get_introduction
  > details/get_thumbnail

  We can even add an get_title.

++ We seem to have lost the preformatted text style. This can be added later
  by a Manager, but we for compatibility we should put in Preformatted at the
  end of the styles list.

-----> pre is still here. If you have other requirements, please provide a Name an
-----> a tag and attributes that should be added to the list of formats.

Login
-----

- I left my screen open overnight, and when I came back the next
  morning I tried to do something. That login form came up, the one
  you can't ever successfully login to. Damn frustrating. What is its
  purpose? Can we remove it?
  I hope so. It also displays a model dialog with "You are now authenticated."
  and the page won't load until you click "Continue". But I realize that this
  is temporary, it's just our users shouldn't use it.

- If you get locked out, you get a modal password prompt in the SMI. I
  could not login with this. I had to reload, which took me back to
  the home page with the nested login form, and then I could
  login. This is real glitch that could frustrate a user.
  Apparently you have to get you login right the first time and then it works.
  Is this fixable?

Properties screen
-----------------

- hide from tables of content

Subscriptions screen
--------------------

++ Subscriptions don't seem to send mail

Image sidebar
-------------

- If an image is cropped, the thumbnail has incorrect proportions in
  the html. If the image is 804x465 pixels scaled to 142x120 pixels,
  the img tag has attributes width="120" height="101". These
  proportions match the crop, but the thumbnail displays the original
  image, and should have the same proportions.

Metadata system
---------------

+ It's not possible to make a metadata set editable. It 404s.

+ It's not possible to add a field to a metadata set. It 404s.

Silva news
----------

- Inside new News Pubs the addables are not set correctly.

++ See the double title:
  http://next30.infrae.com/edit#content!news/silva_security_bulletin_04-10-11
  """WB: The title is not set in the content anymore so it can be removed from the
  content. De we need an updated to remove this titel automatically?"""
