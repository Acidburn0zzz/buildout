Document
--------

- How do we call a document without its title? Looks like @@content.html gets
  the title and the body, but sometimes users call the title elsewhere, higher
  up in the layout template, and they only want the body. Seems like this is a
  problem with news items too. @@body.html ?

   version document/get_viewable
   details version/@@details
   details/get_text
   details/get_introduction
   details/get_thumbnail

This is great. So I changed the code from:

  <tal:tweet tal:define="feeder provider.search('twitterfeeder')"
    tal:condition="feeder is not None">
    <tal:embed tal:replace="structure path:feeder/@@content.html">
      latest tweet
    </tal:embed>
  </tal:tweet>

to:

  <tal:tweet tal:define="feeder provider.search('twitterfeeder')"
    tal:condition="feeder is not None">
    <tal:embed
      tal:define="
        version path:feeder/get_viewable;
        details path:version/@@details"
      tal:replace="structure path:details/get_text">
      latest tweet
    </tal:embed>
  </tal:tweet>

Is there a more efficient way to do this?
I guess you can't combine defines and gets: feeder/get_viewable/details/get_text

-----> It is way faster yes. That would be too easy. And I fixed you
       code so it doesn't fail if there is no published version, and
       works if it is a Ghost, and I moved in the Python file.

CKEditor
--------

- External images get broken after saving. If you add external images,
  they get removed one by one after a save. Looking at the source it
  looks like a stripping action occurs on "<img
  data-silva-src="http://www.packtpub.com/sites/default/files/Article-Images/silva-468x60.gif"
  />" whyich becomes "<img data-silva-=""
  src="http://www.packtpub.com/sites/default/files/Article-Images/silva-468x60.gif"
  />" after a save. After a second save the img element becomes empty.

+ creating sub level lists using the tab doesn't work (FF and IE8). In
  IE8 the SMI green loading lights keep spinning when trying to indent a
  level so probably this is some JS issue.

  Note: moved list types and css selectors from here to
  documentation.txt.  We aren't going to migrate the list styles. Most
  of our customers probably don't use them. However, if the styles -
  like class="square" - are needed they can be added to the
  formats. An Author will then need to first create an unordered list
  using the button in the toolbar, then apply a style to it using the
  format dropdown.

Folder
------

- If you change the order of a container, the order will be reset to its
  previous order after a restart of the server.

Usability

CKEditor
--------

- I added an external image, then previewed the page, and the image was shown.
  Then I went back to the edit page, made some changes to another (internal)
  image, and previewed the page again. Now it didn't show the image anymore (but
  its alternative text). I've tried it a couple of time and the same thing
  happened.
