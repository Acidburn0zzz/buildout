Those issues should be fixed
============================

Testing
=======

Those issues comes from the testing.txt file.

+ The "Request approval history" table in the Publish screen of a doc needs
  attention, e.g.:
  http://preprod30.infrae.com/edit#publish!lobby/testors/codesourceadd
  @Sanne: Looks like we need clear:both or something with the floats. In order
  to fix this you'll need to login as an Author. You can use Torvald's account.
  @Sylvain: Please move this table down so it appears just above the "Manage
  versions" table. Right now the "Publish closed version" table is underneath,
  and "Request approval history" could be a long table.

- Delete: When selecting items for deletion, the form remains sticky
  with selections after deletion, e.g. if you delete versions 2 and 3,
  the form comes back with items 0 and 1 selected.

- Delete: We don't ask, "Are you sure?" on the delete action. Should we?

Manual close

- Under "Manual close", the hint should have the same font-style as
  the field hints. The selector is '.form-head p'. Currently hints are
  in italic (which should change because it doesn't make sense, but
  let's first be consistent).

- Vertical space under "Manual close" between hint and button needs to
  collapse and match the spacing between hints and fields.

+ In a document on infrae.com going to the Customization or Subscriptions
  screen throws an error.

+ Clicking Preferences on 'st' raises error:
  http://pastebin.stonekeep.com/12475 And everything is edited as
  "unknown".

+ Clicking Settings on 'st' raises error:
  http://pastebin.stonekeep.com/12473

++ Empty crop coordinates can't be saved, the field is required, so you need
  to crop every image for a change in image format or scaling.

++ View unscaled image doesn't work.

- You can't remove anchors, not with the remove link, and not with
  backspace are del key.

- Updating an existing anchor names fails. After saving it gets
  replaced with the old anchor name.

+ It's not possible to edit an Anchor. I tried to change this anchor into
  'Forest_Paths'. It doesn't stick after saving. See:
  infrae.com/products/silva/developer/blueprints/shorturls#Marketing_Links

- Anchors don't work in Preview mode. If you click on an anchor you don't go
  to the anchor target.

+ The Indexer is indexing all anchors, not just those that have a title. This
  needs to be fixed. See infrae.com, where the first items have no term but are
  still listed:
    http://infrae.com/edit#preview!../indexer
  From  the docs:
  "The difference is an index item has both a name and a title. The Indexer only
  presents anchor/index items that have a title."

+ If you do a user clipboard the smi keeps spinning, and you need to do
  a browser refresh, to see the user(s) in the clipboard.

Silva News Filter
-----------------

- The "montrer les éléments d'agenda" checkbox with no label looks
  lost. Can we always put a 'Yes" label next to these?

- Title field(s) are too short. Make them size="40".

+ When a document doesn't have a tile, it's id gets displayed instead. Thus one
  thinks the doc does have a title (albeit a lousy one). We need to display the
  string "no title" instead.

-----> This was the same behavior in the old Silva.
-----+ Well, in the Contents screen the old Silva displayed "no title".


= Compare is really cool! Looks and works great!

UI Generic settings
-------------------

Two new fields in the form seem to be required which means you can't edit,
say, just the title. The error says "The URI is malformed."
