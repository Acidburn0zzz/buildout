Document
--------

- The document title seems to have a one-way connection to the metadata title.
  If you edit the metadata title it doesn't show up in the document (yet it's
  used in the SMI listing). However if you edit the title in the document, that
  overwrites the metadata title.

(You cannot remove the title from the document editor. Should this be possible ?)

[Let's keep it this way. The only way to remove the title is in properties.]

To test after upgrade:
+ When upgrading from previous Silvas can we bump up the heading size? So an h3
  becomes h2, etc.

XXX Something's broken, When clicking the "Upload" button (in FF) nothing happens.
Actually, the upload dialog appears, but behind the "Lookup a content" dialog.
But now I can't reproduce this....
++ When looking up an image, then adding one in the dailog, the add form has
  a bizarre layout. Must be missing some key classes for the new css.

+ How do we call a document without its title? Looks like @@content.html gets
  the title and the body, but sometimes users call the title elsewhere, higher
  up in the layout template, and they only want the body. Seems like this is a
  problem with news items too. @@body.html ?

  > version document/get_viewable
  > details version/@@details
  > details/get_text
  > details/get_introduction
  > details/get_thumbnail

  We can even add an get_title.

To test after upgrade:
++ We seem to have lost the preformatted text style. This can be added later
  by a Manager, but we for compatibility we should put in Preformatted at the
  end of the styles list.

-----> pre is still here. If you have other requirements, please provide a Name an
-----> a tag and attributes that should be added to the list of formats.
