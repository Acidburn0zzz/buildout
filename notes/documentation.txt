Manager documentation
=====================

These are items that should be documented:
+ Means do it
- Means only if there's a need

- Migration: in order to preserve list styling the following classes (may) need
  to get migrated.

We aren't going to migrate the list styles. Most of our customers probably don't
use them. However, if the styles - like class="square" are needed, they can be
added to the formats. An Author will then need to first create an unordered list
using the button in the toolbar, then apply a style to it using the format
dropdown.

Unordered lists:

 ul type="disc"   --> ul style="list-style-type: disc;" (now a plain ul)
 ul type="square" --> ul style="list-style-type: square;"
 ul type="circle" --> ul style="list-style-type: circle;"
 ul type="none"   --> ul style="list-style-type: none;"

In Kupu you can select the option to have no bullets (type=none) there is no option to do that anymore in CK.

Ordered lists:

 ol type="1"      --> ol style="list-style-type: decimal;"
 ol type="I"      --> ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman;"
 ol type="i"      --> ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;"
 ol type="A"      --> ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;"
 ol type="a"      --> ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"

Definition lists:

Seems it's not out of the box, but there may be a plugin:
