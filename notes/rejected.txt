Those issues I don't want to fix
================================

Feedback
========

- Can we remove the little 'x' from the feedback messages? Users will think
  they have click it, and it's tiny, while they can click the entire message.

- And moving it down 30 pixels will solve the problem completely :)

CKEditor
========

- The source view has light gray text and is hard to read. If we make it black
  it becomes a darker gray.
.cke_skin_silva textarea.cke_source {
    ....
    color: #000;
}

-----> This is something you changed, before it used to the same color than in Kupu,
