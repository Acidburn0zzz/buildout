Issues with nothing to do on it, where the description / action is incomplete
=============================================================================

Content Layout
==============

= Any feature that adds clicks is not an improvement.

----> This doesn't describe any bug, what am I supposed to do ?

Login
=====

= It seems the login form now appears in the content area of the
  location where you're at, instead of displaying the layout at the
  root of the site. Did this change? It's much more friendly.

----> This doesn't describe any bug, what am I supposed to do ?

Logout
======

- When a user logs out, they are sent to service_members/logout. This
  triggers the login form to appear. Why? If you want to log in again,
  you can't. Can we just send them to the public view of where they
  were?

----> I cannot reproduce this.

- When you logout from a certain location you can still visit that page in the
  smi which looks like your still logged in, only when you do a hard refresh
  (or other action like edit) you get the login screen. I suppose this has to
  do with caching and that it is not an issue.

----> I cannot reproduce this
