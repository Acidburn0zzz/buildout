Issues with nothing to do on it, where the description / action is incomplete

CKEditor
========

++ When inserting an image that is scaled to 20%, CKEditor inserts the full size
  hires version. See the Silva icon:

-----> If you look at the hires version, I believe this is 20%:

       Or this bug got fixed in the mean time (I believe it just be a
       caching issue on your browser, that I already fixed).

Code source
===========

No problems here, just wanted to say that the new forms that link to
the file system are great. They work really well, allowing the manager
to decide what to do. This also solves the problem of copying and
changing, as you can disconnect as well. That was brilliant.

Logout
======

- When a user logs out, they are sent to service_members/logout. This
  triggers the login form to appear. Why? If you want to log in again,
  you can't. Can we just send them to the public view of where they
  were?

----> I cannot reproduce this.

++++> Go to http://preprod30.infrae.com/edit#content!about
      Click the logout button. You end up at:
      http://preprod30.infrae.com/service_members/logout
      You see a login form but you cannot login at this address.
