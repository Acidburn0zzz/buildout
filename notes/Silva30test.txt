Silva 3.0 test notes
====================

General comments
----------------
- Test area: http://next30.infrae.com/edit#publish!products/lxml

- Error feedback needs to be pink or a bright color. On a large screen, clicking buttons at the bottom of the window, I didn't even notice the feedback, and started to make a bug report that nothing happened.

- "Publish Now" button in the header should read "Publish now"


DONE signal

- DONE "Informations" should be "Information".

When something's done I'll test it and, assuming a positive result, delete it from this list.


Publish screen of docs
----------------------

Publication time

- Manually filling in 28-8-11 causes an error (on the 11). The server should interpret the 11 as 2011.

- The "Publish now" action fails if there is a bad date in the "Publication time" field. This is strange because the Publication time is now, not the field value.


Expiration time

- When a doc has been published with an expiration date, that date should be prefilled when editing/publishing the doc again. Now the field is empty and the exp date gets removed on next publication.


Submit buttons and reporting

- When a doc is approved for the future, you can't see that it is approved for the future. The only signal is the "Publish Now" button changes to "Revoke Approval". No information about the future date of publication is visible. You only see "Manage versions". It's especially confusing if a doc is already published, then you see "Manaal close" and a "x Close published version" button, but nothing about the approval (http://next30.infrae.com/edit#publish!products/lxml). We can display the future approval date in the "Information", but I'd rather see it in the form body itself because that's where users will be searching.

- It used to be possible to change to future dates when a doc was approved for the future with an "Update timings" button. We can leave that out if it's complicated, but that made the approved for future state completely clear. Plus easy to edit.

- When the "Publish Now" button in the header changes to "Revoke Approval" it should say "Revoke approval".


Manual close

- Under "Manual close", the hint should have the same font-style as the field hints. The selector is '.form-head p'. Currently hints are in italic (which should change because it doesn't make sense, but let's first be consistent).

- Vertical space under "Manual close" between hint and button needs to collapse and match the spacing between hints and fields.


Manage versions

- If we wish we can remove the spacetime from the "Modification time  Publication time 	Expiration time" table headings. It's obvious the values are times. Ha ha ha, if we wish we can remove the ' time'.

- Personally I miss the link colors for Unapproved, Published, and Last closed. They made it so clear and you could instantly see what was what. Now you have to read each one. We do have room to put colored balls next to the version number but they don't really fit.

- Please make the version status text a link to view it. Now we're adding a click, by making users first select a checkbox, then click "View".

- If you don't select anything and click "Delete", the feedback says "Version(s) deleted."

- If you don't select anything and a click "Copy for editing", the feedback says "Select only one version to view it." If we change this to "Please select one version to view it." this will cover both the nothing-selected and too-many selected use cases.

- Delete: When selecting items for deletion, the form remains sticky with selections after deletion, e.g. if you delete versions 2 and 3, the form comes back with items 0 and 1 selected.

- View: viewing an old version shows it as default html. It should be wrapped in layout like preview.

- View: when viewing an old version there's no obvious way to get back the publish screen. We can let people learn to click on the already selected tab, but....

- View: when viewing an old version the "Publish now" button in the header should not appear, as you're not publishing the version you're viewing. Maybe change it to a back button.

- Compare: doesn't compare.

- Compare: can you compare across batch screens?


Date rendering and interpretation

- Rendered times, e.g. Aug 25, 2011 12:00:00 PM, have ' AM' or ' PM' appended which is never used with 24-hour time. These can be removed which will make dates shorter too.

- If I fill in a publication time of 12:00 (thus midday), and only a date for the expiration date with no time, the result is the following:

Pub: Aug 25, 2011 12:00:00 PM
Exp: Aug 30, 2011 12:00:00 AM

The pub date should be Aug 25, 2011 12:00:00
The exp date should be Aug 30, 2011 00:00:00

- We don't need the seconds on the date either. Saves three chars per date.

- We're rendering the dates semi-American style, when we used to use European notation: day / month / year (23:59). Compare the length.
Aug 25, 2011 12:00:00 AM
25 Aug 11 17:30

By using the shorter rendering we can save lots of space and get more dates on one line. Now all dates are always breaking onto two lines (in this screen).


Buttons

- The "Approve for future", "Publish now", "Close published version", "Compare", and probably more buttons/links don't have a title attribute any more. Check an older Silva for the attribute content.

- Some buttons have icons, others don't (x Delete, Copy, View, Compare). This is inconsistent. Maybe we should only use icons when all the buttons have icons, like in contents.
