== general UI ==

- the form-content should be made smaller on every page (this will also fix the problem of the error message being positioned 
  outside the screen). The <div> should be given a <class="forms">. 
- I think all 'positive' buttons should have a green icon and all 'negative' buttons should have a red icon. There should only
  be an icon in the buttons when it makes sense (for example, I don't think the little circles in the buttons add any meaning 
  to the action that button performs).
- non-editable fields are now skipped when using tab. However, they are still focused when selected. 

== portlet ==

- when there's multiple H4's in the portlet, it looks too crowded. And also when the title is longer than one line, it does not   
  look good. The H4's in the portlet can be different from the ones in the form-content.  

== add 'Silva page' == 

- the cursor in the title bar is set as pointer. Since this is not a link, it should probably be default. 

== add 'Image' ==

- when you click 'send' without uploading an image, a progress bar shows, when it probably shouldn't. 

== Settings screen ==

- On the 'manage subscriptions' page, the textarea is too wide (it has inline styling, so it needs a change to the HTML). 

== dialog boxes ==

- the style of the cke_dialog boxes is different from the other dialog boxes. It should probably be more consistent. 
- the 'upload' dialog box displays a scroll bar. The box now has a width of 300px (inline styling). Changing the width 
  to 310px will fix it. 
- the buttons in dialog boxes look different from the others. I think all buttons should look the same. 

== error messages ==

- the border-left on error messages only appears when the field is not focused. It should also appear when focused. 

== ideas ==

- maybe we can add the icon of each content type in the tab 'add'.
