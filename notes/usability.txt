Just checking, did you svn up? :) Yes, I did :) 

== general UI ==

- the form-content should be made smaller on every page (this will also fix the problem of the error message being positioned 
  outside the screen). The <div> should be given a <class="forms">. 
- I think all 'positive' buttons should have a green icon and all 'negative' buttons should have a red icon. There should only
  be an icon in the buttons when it makes sense (for example, I don't think the little circles in the buttons add any meaning 
  to the action that button performs).
- non-editable fields are now skipped when using tab. However, they are still focused when selected. 

== portlet ==

- when there's multiple H4's in the portlet, it looks too crowded. And also when the title is longer than one line, it does not   
  look good. The H4's in the portlet can be different from the ones in the form-content.  

== add 'Silva page' == 

- the cursor in the title bar is set as pointer. Since this is not a link, it should probably be default. 

== add 'Image' ==

- when you click 'send' without uploading an image, a progress bar shows, when it probably shouldn't. 

== Settings screen ==

- On the 'manage subscriptions' page, the textarea is too wide (it has inline styling, so it needs a change to the HTML). 

== dialog boxes ==

- the style of the cke_dialog boxes is different from the other dialog boxes. It should probably be more consistent. 
- the 'upload' dialog box displays a scroll bar. The box now has a width of 300px (inline styling). Changing the width 
  to 310px will fix it. 
- the buttons in dialog boxes look different from the others. I think all buttons should look the same. 

== error messages ==

- the border-left on error messages only appears when the field is not focused. It should also appear when focused. 

== ideas ==

- maybe we can add the icon of each content type in the tab 'add'. 

== CKEditor ==

- when looking up an image, the icon of the identifier should be clickable as well, either for moving into a folder, or 
  for adding an image (instead of having to move your cursor to the right to add something). I keep clicking
  the icon, expecting it will be added, before I realize I need to click the add icon. 
  Or maybe you should be able to select an image and then click an 'Add' button in the right bottom corner. 

- when you add a 'link to the hires version of the image', the link does not lead you to the unscaled or uncropped image. 

- 'Link to an another content' should be changed to 'Link to another content'. 

- when you've added an external image, and you want to make some changes later, you have to fill in the external URL again, it 
  doesn't stick.  

- the 'use image alternative text as caption' check box is checked by default. However, only when you uncheck the box,
  it shows the input field. Somehow it doesn't make sense that the input field does not show when the box is checked. 
  Maybe the input field should always be there, automatically filling in the caption when checking the checkbox. 

- I added an external image, then previewed the page, and the image was shown. Then I went back to the edit page, made some   
  changes to another (internal) image, and previewed the page again. Now it didn't show the image anymore (but its alternative 
  text). I've tried it a couple of time and the same thing happened.
