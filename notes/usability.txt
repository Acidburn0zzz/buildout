Usability issues
================

-- new issues are marked with * --

== general UI ==

* It could be handy to see as which user your are logged in.

* The 'view' button opens in a new window, my [wimbou] personal preference is 
  to get rid of this behaviour as you soon start to get a tab overhead. Better
  would be view in same window and use the browser back button to go back to 
  the edit mode.

== buttons and icons ==

* The 'add' and 'remove' buttons on some 'add' pages, e.g. 'add a Silva agenda
  item', need some text spacing adjustment.
  are styled different from the other buttons.
  I gave them the same styling as the other buttons. While in general the
  'negative action' buttons is on the right, and the 'positive action' button
  is on the left, in the case, it's the other way around.
    [Kit] They should be the other way around :)
      = I've added the icons as a background-image to the buttons (see above).
        Now, the bg color is different from the other buttons, because their
        background is an image. I think it needs a change to the HTML to
        keep the bg and the icon.
    + They need adjustment, see:
      next30.infrae.com/edit#adding/Silva Agenda Item!../news/events
* Logged in as author: when you've edited something and request approvel, you
  click the button 'request approval', which now has a 'check' icon. You can
  withdraw your request by clicking the 'withdraw request' button, which has
  a 'cross' icon, which makes sense. Then when you go to the publish screen,
  in the header, there's still the negative button, but in the workspace there
  a button which has the same text, 'withdraw approval request', but has a
  'check' icon.

* Logged in as editor: when you close a document in the content overview,
  you can not immidiately publish it. You hove to select it then Select
  'Publish' from the Go to menu.

== add 'Silva page' ==

+ the cursor in the title bar is set as pointer. Since this is not a link, it
  should probably be default.

== Upload ==

+ when you click 'send' without uploading an image, a progress bar shows. It
  probably shouldn't.

== add 'Silva agenda page' ==

* The 'happens' in the label p should be changed to 'happen'.
* When filling in a date, I get an error message, saying 'missing day/month/
  year/ value', when moving from on field to another.
* You are able to fill in a date in the past. Maybe there shoud be an error
  message when you do that?
* Selecting a timezone other than 'local' yields an error message.
* Because the 'add' and 'remove' buttons are below the form, you might think
  that you have to click 'add' after filling in the above form to add the
  event.
  If you want to remove an occurrence, you have to check the box above the
  form and then click the 'remove' button below the form. It would make more
  sense if those two were closer together, so you know checking the box is
  related to the remove button.
  Same applies to adding a RSS Aggregator.

== Content screen ==

* When deleting multiple images, it breaks even if only one image is 
  referenced in a document. It would be better if it would delete all 
  non referenced images and then end saying. Could not delete image x, y, 
  z as they are referenced.

== Publish screen ==

* Under 'manage version' the 'compare button' is the only button without
  a title attribute.
* In the portlet, when an item is pending, the p should be changed from
  'This is item has..' to 'This item has..'.
* Unapproved should be renamed to draft as draft != unapproved &&
  pending == unapproved

== error messages ==

== ideas ==

- maybe we can add the icon of each content type in the tab 'add'.
  I would love it too.

- If you're in a Local site it would be nice that the "Manage" link goes
  to the zmi of that local site and not the Silva root.

== CKEditor ==

+ when looking up an image, the icon of the identifier should be clickable as
  well, either for moving into a folder, or for adding an image (instead of
  having to move your cursor to the right to add something). I keep clicking the
  icon, expecting it will be added, before I realize I need to click the add
  icon. Or maybe you should be able to select an image and then click an 'Add'
  button in the right bottom corner.
    Kit: This will need to change when we make the id/titles links.

+ it would be handy if you would be able to go from the image properties
  in the editor, to the image properties in silva to resize/crop the
  corresponding image.

+ target links can't be followed in edit mode, most cms allow a ctrl +
  click on the link to open in a new tab or window.

== Silva CSV Source ==

+ Add an option to set the delimiter as LibreOffice now also uses
  Semicolon. By default it falls back to ','

To Fix
======

+ The location indication in the sidebar is really subtle, the current container
  turns bold. Let's add some more indication. How about a bg?

Login form
----------

Contents screen
---------------
+ The colored ball icons, which show the version state of the document, require
  a title attribute (title="Published") to be added to the 'ins' tag. This needs
  to be done with Sylvain. There are five states:
  Draft, Pending, Approved, Published, Closed

Copied from testing.txt:
Publish screen of a doc
-----------------------
- The "Request approval history" table in the Publish screen of a doc needs
  attention, e.g.:
  http://preprod30.infrae.com/edit#publish!lobby/testors/codesourceadd
  @Sylvain: Please move this table down so it appears just above the "Manage
  versions" table. Right now the "Publish closed version" table is underneath,
  and "Request approval history" could be a long table.

For Sanne's review:

Reference dialog
----------------

@Sanne: ask about upcoming changes to the Contents screen links, and then this
will make more sense....

- In the reference dialog clicking the icon of a non-container doesn't do
  anything. Make it trigger the same action as the 'plus' icon on the right.
  This obviates the need to move the mouse across the screen, which new
  users find confusing because the selection checkbox used to be on the left.
  """WB: Non of the icons reference the add action, only the '+' icon adds a
  reference."""

-------> If you click on the icon of a container, you go inside this
         container, in order to have the same behavior than the
         generic folder listing. This was discussed on the ML to have
         the same behavior.

-------> By so, clicking on the icon of a content doesn't select it,
         as it will be a different behavior for container and
         non-containers.

-------+ I think once we get the links working, this will become less of an
         issue. It'll be very obvious that you need to click on the folder id
         or title to enter it. The behavior in the lookup window should be more
         or less the same as the Contents screen:
         - Hover over any row and it changes to a darker color
         - Hover over a content icon, see a preview
         - Hover over a container icon, see the metatype
         - Hover over a container id and the link underlines and turns blue
         - Hover over a container title and the link underlines and turns blue
         - Hover over a content item id and nothing happens
         - Hover over a content title and nothing happens

         In order to select, click on empty space in the row:
         - For content, selecting is the same as clicking the plus button, so
           clicking anywhere, including on the id/title selects the item(s).
         - For containers, if it's selectable (like for a TOC) the behavior
           stays the same as with content. If the container is not selectable
           (as with an image lookup) nothing happens. If the user wants to
           descend into the container the id/title must be clicked. This allows
           multiple items to be easily selected.

== Thoughts on link styling ==

Regarding the links on the content page and the lookup window, I think making
the title and id slightly darker and underlining them on hover, might be
sufficient, because the user probably expects those to be links anyway (at least
I did at first).
There are links in the Information portlet that need a different color, to make
clear those are links (e.g. the word 'editor' in the portlet when an item is
published).


Interface update
================

- We need link styling for the text in the UI. Example:
  "RSS/Atom is activated for this container. You can access the RSS feed at
  this URL, and the Atom feed at this URL." Both of the URL words are in fact
  links but you can't see that. It needs to be very obvious, jumping out at
  the user, this is a link. Maybe good old blue.

- There's a problem with indenting of the fields and headers. Go to the
  Settings screen of a publication like:
  http://next30.infrae.com/edit#settings!../news

- We need dl styling in the Information portlet for the new Short URL feature.
