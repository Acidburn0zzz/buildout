Usability issues
================

-- new issues are marked with * --

== general UI ==

+ the form-content should be made smaller on every page (this will also fix the
  problem of the error message being positioned outside the screen). The <div>
  should be given a <class="forms">.
* Sometimes there is a check box which is required; unchecking the check box
  yields an error message. Since you don't have an option, should this be a
  check box, or something that not editable?
* There should be a border-left on the subtab icon of the 'add' tab, as
  the 'content' and 'settings' tab have.

== buttons ==

- I think all 'positive' buttons should have a green icon and all 'negative'
  buttons should have a red icon.
  There should only be an icon in the buttons when it makes sense (for example,
  I don't think the little circles in the buttons add any meaning to the action
  that button performs).
  [Kit] The problem is that sometimes there's a row of buttons, some with icons,
  some without, and that looks really strange. So we decided to have a generic
  icon for visual consistency. Someday we may choose icons for all buttons, but
  in practice people only recognize a few icons.
  BTW, I really like the idea of green for 'Go' actions and red for 'negative'
  actions. Think about how to implement that....
  * I've changed the icon on the cancel button to a red cross, which I think
    looks better.
    However,  although I think the icon related to 'cancel' should be a red
    cross, the cancel button takes you back to the previous screen, so
    in this way the 'return arrow' icon makes more sense..
      We actually want the cancel buttons that take you back to the previous
      screen to read "Back", and then the return arrow fits. But that requires
      some doing....
    Regarding visual consistency, it may look strange if some icons are
    colored and others are not.
* The 'add' and 'remove' buttons on some 'add' pages, e.g. add a Silva agenda
  page', are styled different from the other buttons.
    I gave them the same styling as the other buttons. While in general the
    'negative action' buttons is on the right, and the 'positive action' button
    is on the left, in the case, it's the other way around. They may
    need to have icons as well.
      We can use a green plus and red minus icon. They're in the set.

== add 'Silva page' ==

+ the cursor in the title bar is set as pointer. Since this is not a link, it
  should probably be default.

== add 'Image' ==

+ when you click 'send' without uploading an image, a progress bar shows, when
  it probably shouldn't.

== add 'Silva agenda page' ==

* The 'happens' in the label p should be changed to 'happen'.
* When filling in a date, I get an error message, saying 'missing day/month/
  year/ value', when moving from on field to another.
* You are able to fill in a date in the past. Maybe there shoud be an error
  message when you do that?
* Selecting a timezone other than 'local' yields an error message.
* Because the 'add' and 'remove' buttons are below the form, you might think
  that you have to click 'add' after filling in the above form to add the
  event.
  If you want to remove an occurrence, you have to check the box above the
  form and then click the 'remove' button below the form. It would make more
  sense if those two were closer together, so you know checking the box is
  related to the buttons.
  Same applies to adding a RSS Aggregator.

== Settings screen ==

+ On the 'manage subscriptions' page, the textarea is too wide (it has inline
  styling, so it needs a change to the HTML).
* On the 'settings'-'manage' page, there's a required marker without CSS
  applied to it.

== Publish screen ==

* Under 'manage version' the 'compare button' is the only button without
  a title attribute.
* In the portlet, when an item is pending, the p should be changed from
  'This is item has..' to 'This item has..'.

== error messages ==

+ the border-left on error messages only appears when the field is not focused.
  It should also appear when focused.

== ideas ==

- maybe we can add the icon of each content type in the tab 'add'.

  I would love it too.

== CKEditor ==

+ when looking up an image, the icon of the identifier should be clickable as
  well, either for moving into a folder, or for adding an image (instead of
  having to move your cursor to the right to add something). I keep clicking the
  icon, expecting it will be added, before I realize I need to click the add
  icon. Or maybe you should be able to select an image and then click an 'Add'
  button in the right bottom corner.

To Fix
======

Login form
----------
- This is the form that appears when you leave an SMI window open overnight and
  try to do something.
  + The id and password fields should be wider.
    = changing the width of the form field affects all fields. In some cases,
      e.g. in adding a TOC - 'depth of listing', or in case of a date,
      the fielda are too wide. I asked Sylvain and he will fix this.

Contents screen
---------------
+ The colored ball icons, which show the version state of the document, require
  a title attribute (title="Published") to be added to the 'ins' tag. This needs
  to be done with Sylvain. There are five states:
  Draft, Pending, Approved, Published, Closed

Copied from testing.txt:
Properties screen
-----------------
- Some fields have class="field" with a 2px margin, others don't.
  Example: http://preprod30.infrae.com/edit#properties!lobby/testors
  The textareas are wrapped in a class="form-field" and then class="field". The
  select and string fields are not wrapped with class="field" and thus the
  Acquired value p bumps against the field.

Copied from testing.txt:
Publish screen of a doc
-----------------------
- The "Request approval history" table in the Publish screen of a doc needs
  attention, e.g.:
  http://preprod30.infrae.com/edit#publish!lobby/testors/codesourceadd
  @Sanne: Looks like we need clear:both or something with the floats. In order
  to fix this you'll need to login as an Author. You can use Torvald's account.
  @Sylvain: Please move this table down so it appears just above the "Manage
  versions" table. Right now the "Publish closed version" table is underneath,
  and "Request approval history" could be a long table.



For Sanne's review:

Reference dialog
----------------

@Sanne: ask about upcoming changes to the Contents screen links, and then this
will make more sense....

- In the reference dialog clicking the icon of a non-container doesn't do
  anything. Make it trigger the same action as the 'plus' icon on the right.
  This obviates the need to move the mouse across the screen, which new
  users find confusing because the selection checkbox used to be on the left.
  """WB: Non of the icons reference the add action, only the '+' icon adds a
  reference."""

-------> If you click on the icon of a container, you go inside this
         container, in order to have the same behavior than the
         generic folder listing. This was discussed on the ML to have
         the same behavior.

-------> By so, clicking on the icon of a content doesn't select it,
         as it will be a different behavior for container and
         non-containers.

-------+ I think once we get the links working, this will become less of an
         issue. It'll be very obvious that you need to click on the folder id
         or title to enter it. The behavior in the lookup window should be more
         or less the same as the Contents screen:
         - Hover over any row and it changes to a darker color
         - Hover over a content icon, see a preview
         - Hover over a container icon, see nothing (or metatype?)
         - Hover over a container id and the link underlines and turns blue
         - Hover over a container title and the link underlines and turns blue
         - Hover over a content item id and nothing happens
         - Hover over a container title and nothing happens

         In order to select, click on empty space in the row:
         - For content, selecting is the same as clicking the plus button, so
           clicking anywhere, including on the id/title selects the item(s).
         - For containers, if it's selectable (like for a TOC) the behavior
           stays the same as with content. If the container is not selectable
           (as with an image lookup) nothing happens. If the user wants to
           descend into the container the id/title must be clicked. This allows
           multiple items to be easily selected.
