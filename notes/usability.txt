Usability issues
================

== general UI ==

- the form-content should be made smaller on every page (this will also fix the
  problem of the error message being positioned outside the screen). The <div>
  should be given a <class="forms">.
- I think all 'positive' buttons should have a green icon and all 'negative'
  buttons should have a red icon.
  There should only be an icon in the buttons when it makes sense (for example,
  I don't think the little circles in the buttons add any meaning to the action
  that button performs).
  [Kit] The problem is that sometimes there's a row of buttons, some with icons,
  some without, and that looks really strange. So we decided to have a generic
  icon for visual consistency. Someday we may choose icons for all buttons, but
  in practice people only recognize a few icons. I like the idea of green for
  'Go' actions and red for 'negative' actions.
- non-editable fields are now skipped when using tab. However, they are still
  focused when selected. [see below]

== portlet ==

- when there's multiple H4's in the portlet, it looks too crowded. And also when
  the title is longer than one line, it does not look good. The H4's in the
  portlet can be different from the ones in the form-content.

== add 'Silva page' ==

- the cursor in the title bar is set as pointer. Since this is not a link, it
  should probably be default.

== add 'Image' ==

- when you click 'send' without uploading an image, a progress bar shows, when
  it probably shouldn't.

== Settings screen ==

- On the 'manage subscriptions' page, the textarea is too wide (it has inline
  styling, so it needs a change to the HTML).

== dialog boxes ==

- the style of the cke_dialog boxes is different from the other dialog boxes. It
  should probably be more consistent.
- the 'upload' dialog box displays a scroll bar. The box now has a width of
  300px (inline styling). Changing the width to 310px will fix it.
- the buttons in dialog boxes look different from the others. I think all
  buttons should look the same.

== error messages ==

- the border-left on error messages only appears when the field is not focused.
  It should also appear when focused.

== ideas ==

- maybe we can add the icon of each content type in the tab 'add'.

== CKEditor ==

- when looking up an image, the icon of the identifier should be clickable as
  well, either for moving into a folder, or for adding an image (instead of
  having to move your cursor to the right to add something). I keep clicking the
  icon, expecting it will be added, before I realize I need to click the add
  icon. Or maybe you should be able to select an image and then click an 'Add'
  button in the right bottom corner.

- when you add a 'link to the hires version of the image', the link does not
  lead you to the unscaled or uncropped image.

- 'Link to an another content' should be changed to 'Link to another content item'.

- when you've added an external image, and you want to make some changes later,
  you have to fill in the external URL again, it doesn't stick.

- the 'use image alternative text as caption' check box is checked by default.
  However, only when you uncheck the box, it shows the input field. Somehow it
  doesn't make sense that the input field does not show when the box is checked.
  Maybe the input field should always be there, automatically filling in the
  caption when checking the checkbox.

- I added an external image, then previewed the page, and the image was shown.
  Then I went back to the edit page, made some changes to another (internal)
  image, and previewed the page again. Now it didn't show the image anymore (but
  its alternative text). I've tried it a couple of time and the same thing
  happened.

To Fix
======

+ An h4 in the information portlet has both a border and an underline. The
  underline can go, the border is enough text-decoration. Maybe those h4s should
  have a bg color? Maybe not....

- Do we need a little more space between the forms? See the forms in the above
  example. Say, 30px?

Properties screen
-----------------
+ On focus, the field element texts darken. Make that happen on hover too.
  Sometimes I focus a field just to read the gray acquired metadata better.
- The textareas need a little padding (2px?), they look cramped.

- The Acquirable and Acquired Value markers don't line up perfectly. See a
  published document.
+ The "acquirable" marker is not long enough.
+ In the Acquirable and Acquired Value markers, since the letters are all caps,
  they sit a little high.
  Actually, why are these 'uppercase'? If you make them 'capitalize', everything
  fits! :)

Login form
----------
- This is the form that appears when you leave an SMI window open overnight and
  try to do something.
  + The required marker should be float:right so it's close to the field.
  + The id and password fields should be wider.
  + The Cancel and Login buttons are small, should have more padding to make
    easier click targets.
  + After login, a modal dialogue appears with a Continue button that should
    be larger too.

Contents screen
---------------
+ The colored ball icons, which show the version state of the document, require
  a title attribute (title="Published") to be added to the 'ins' tag. This needs
  to be done with Sylvain. There are five states:
  Draft, Pending, Approved, Published, Closed
