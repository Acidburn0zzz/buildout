Silva 3.0 test notes
====================

DONE signal

DONE - "Informations" should be "Information".

When something's done I'll test it and, assuming a positive result, delete it from this list.


General comments
----------------
Nothing to do ? - New feedback colors are much more noticeable.

- Changing languages does not change the UI. The user must reload. Can
  we do that for the user?

- When requested to login again, we should prefill the identifier for
  the user.

- When a user logs in, we provide a modal alert and the user has to
  click "Continue". This is a useless click. Change it to (non-modal)
  feedback instead.


Import screen
-------------

Export screen
-------------

- It's not possible to export one document anymore. This was a useful
  feature. Can we bring it back?

Contents screen, logged in as Author
------------------------------------

DONE - The "Go to" button in the listing does not have "Publish".

Access screen
-------------

- You can remove your own role, and then you're locked out. :-) This
  wasn't possible before.

- If you get locked out, you get a model password prompt in the SMI. I
  could not login with this. I had to reload, which took me back to
  the home page with the nested login form, and then I could
  login. This is real glitch that could frustrate a user.

Settings screen of folder
-------------------------

- When changing a folder to a publication, after I click the convert
  button, I get feedback but nothing happens. The sidebar doesn't
  change and the icon in the header is still a folder icon. I have to
  reload to see the changes.

Publish screen of docs, logged in as Author
-------------------------------------------

- If an Editor wrote a message with the rejection of approval it
  doesn't appear for the Author to read. Some parties depend on this
  internal messaging.

Error

DONE - After an Author requests approval, the Properties screen errors
  ("An error internal happened").

UPGRADED - I upgraded the site and there is no longer any error. But I
  don't know if the error was fixed, or just reverted by the
  upgrade. - An internal error happens when clicking on the Properties
  tab of: http://next30.infrae.com/edit#publish!service/index And now
  I can't delete those old versions.


Publish screen of docs, logged in as ChiefEditor
------------------------------------------------

- If an Author wrote a message with the request for approval it
  doesn't appear for the Editor to read.

+ To test: Is the publishing workflow email working?

Functional fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Error alert

- Why does the "An internal error happened" alert need to be modal?
  It's already frustrating, and it forces the user to click
  "Continue". We can save her a click plus the annoyance by making it
  not modal. Just click where you want to go and the alert disappears.

Ok. DONE - Can we say this? "An internal error happened on the
server. Your system administrator has been informed of the problem."
We should really do this. If internal errors happen we want to know
about it.

+ Do we actually inform the sysadmin? Or is it just logged. ;-)

Datetime fields

Publication time

- The "Publish now" action fails if there is a bad date in the
  "Publication time" field. This is wrong because the Publication time
  is now, not the field value. Several minutes could have passed, so
  the system datetime should be used. The field value is irrelevant.

- Manually filling in 28-8-11 causes an error (on the 11). The server
  should interpret the 11 as 2011. Only happens for Editors, for
  Authors the year is correctly interpreted. Should be easy to
  fix. Then we can probably ignore the following:

- Wrong feedback after internal system error. To reproduce, go to a
  document and fill in a year of '11'. Click "Publish now". You'll
  get the "An internal error happened" alert. Click "Continue". Then
  click a folder in the sidebar. Feedback appears, saying "Version
  published".

Notes since changing the fields

- If I remove the year completely, the whole row goes pink and I get
  validation feedback "Missing year value.". However if I fill in
  '11', the only feedback is the pink glowing border, and I can still
  submit and the error described above.

- Why can Authors successfully submit a year of '11' but not Editors?
  The '11' gets correctly interpreted en Authors submit, but Editors
  get a system error. Can you make it interpret correctly for Editors
  too? Saves 2 chars.

Expiration time

- When a doc has been published with an expiration date, that date
  must be prefilled when editing/publishing the doc again. Now the
  field is empty and the exp date gets removed on next publication.

- It used to be possible to change the future dates when a doc was
  approved for the future with an "Update timings" button. We can
  leave that out if it's complicated, but that made the approved for
  future state completely clear. Plus easy to edit. As it is now you
  need to revoke and then approve again.

Manage versions

- Please make the version status text a link to view it. Now we're
  adding a click, by making users first select a checkbox, then click
  "View".

- Delete: When selecting items for deletion, the form remains sticky
  with selections after deletion, e.g. if you delete versions 2 and 3,
  the form comes back with items 0 and 1 selected.

- Delete: We don't ask, "Are you sure?" on the delete action. Should we?

- View: viewing an old version shows it as default html. It should be wrapped in layout like preview.

- View: when viewing an old version the "Publish now" button in the
  header should not appear, as you're not publishing the version
  you're viewing. Change it to a "Return" button?

- Compare: doesn't compare.

- Compare: can you compare across batch screens?

- If I fill in a publication time of 12:00 (thus midday), and only a date for the expiration date with no time, the result is the following:

Pub: Aug 25, 2011 12:00:00 PM
Exp: Aug 30, 2011 12:00:00 AM

The pub date should be Aug 25, 2011 12:00:00
The exp date should be Aug 30, 2011 00:00:00

Buttons

DONE - Some of them didn't have any description, except accesskey: foo
- The "Approve for future", "Publish now", "Close published version",
"Compare", and probably more buttons/links don't have a title
attribute any more. Check an older Silva for the attribute content.

DONE - Since we're capitalizing now, all the title attributes should
have their first letter capitalized.

Publication time

DONE - This field should not be required for Authors. The Author may
suggest a pub date but doesn't have to. (It's not required with the
"Request approval" button above.)

Properties screen
-----------------

hide from tables of content

- The hide from tables of content field absolutely does not belong in
  Properties. It should be in Settings. We should change this now as
  part of the content upgrade.

- This screen really needs interaction design. I'm going to see if
  Gert has an afternoon.

Subscriptions screen
--------------------

+ Errors when enabling subscriptions


Image
=====

Image sidebar
-------------

- If an image is cropped, the thumbnail has incorrect proportions in
  the html. If the image is 804x465 pixels scaled to 142x120 pixels,
  the img tag has attributes width="120" height="101". These
  proportions match the crop, but the thumbnail displays the original
  image, and should have the same proportions.

- We need to display the image, in its "web configuration", in the
  edit screen.

DONE - The "view unscaled image" link does not look like a link.

DONE - The "view unscaled image" open the image in a new window. Let's
  load the image like we do in preview, so the user stays in the UI.

- In the the edit tab the edit icon for docs in References is not
  found.


Link
====

target of relative link

DONE - This is incorrect: "Make a reference to internal content by
  looking it up. Click the search icon to choose a target." Change to
  "Make a reference to internal content by looking it up." Then:

DONE - Change "no reference selected" to "Click the Lookup button to
  select a reference."

DONE - When creating a link, saving fails with the feedback "Absolute
  link selected without URL." Change to "Absolute link selected without
  URL. If the link goes to content in Silva, put a checkmark in the
  relative link field."

Add forms
=========

- The generic id and title field are too short. The id can't hold more
  than:'new_directions_in_econi'. This is way too short for our
  clients. Those firlds should have a size that matches the
  textareas. For now make them bigger, like size="40".

Ghost, Ghost Folder, Link

- Change "no reference selected" to "Click the Lookup button to select
  a reference. "

Silva News Filter

- Title field(s) are too short. Make them size="40".

- The "montrer les éléments d'agenda" checkbox with no label looks
  lost. Can we always put a 'Yes" label next to these?

Silva News Viewer

THIS OPTION IS DOESN'T EXIST ANYMORE - The "proxy mode" checkbox with
  no label looks lost. Can we always put a 'Yes" label next to these?

Metadata system
===============

+ It's not possible to make a metadata set editable. It 404s.

+ It's not possible to add a field to a metadata set. It 404s.


UI/usability fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Submit buttons and reporting

- When a doc is approved for the future, you can't see that it is
  approved for the future. The only indication is the "Publish Now"
  button changes to "Revoke Approval". No information about the future
  date of publication is visible. You only see "Manage versions". It's
  especially confusing if a doc is already published, then you see
  "Manaal close" and a "x Close published version" button, but nothing
  about the approval:
  (http://next30.infrae.com/edit#publish!products/lxml). We can
  display the future approval date in the "Information", but I'd
  rather see it in the form body itself because that's where users
  will be looking.

Manual close

- Under "Manual close", the hint should have the same font-style as
  the field hints. The selector is '.form-head p'. Currently hints are
  in italic (which should change because it doesn't make sense, but
  let's first be consistent).

- Vertical space under "Manual close" between hint and button needs to
  collapse and match the spacing between hints and fields.


Manage versions

- Personally I miss the link colors for Unapproved, Published, and
  Last closed. They made it so clear and you could instantly see what
  was what. Now you have to read each one. We do have room to put
  colored balls next to the version number but they won't look good.

- View: when viewing an old version there's no obvious way to get back
  the publish screen. We can let people learn to click on the already
  selected tab, but that's not obvious.

(BROWSER->DUTCH) Date rendering and interpretation

DONE - Rendered times, e.g. Aug 25, 2011 12:00:00 PM, have ' AM' or '
  PM' appended which is never used with 24-hour time. These can be
  removed which will make dates shorter too.

DONE - We don't need the seconds on the date either. Saves three chars
  per date.

DONE - We're rendering the dates semi-American style, while we use use
  European notation in the datetime fields: day / month / year
  (23:59). Compare the length.
Aug 25, 2011 12:00:00 AM
25 Aug 11 17:30

DONE - Let's figure something out for these overkill
  dates. Translated, schmanslated.  No seconds, no AM/PM, UK structure
  to match our datetime fields.

By using the shorter rendering we can save lots of space, reduce
clutter, and get more dates on one line. Now all dates are always
breaking onto two lines (in this screen).


More Notes (27-28 aug and later)
================================

- The "Settings" tab at the top of the screen should be an optioned
  button like the "Content" tab. If you click Settings, you go to
  Settings. If you click the down arrow, you see the options: Access,
  Addables, Customization, etc.

- Logout and in: after clicking the logout button the browser goes to:
  http://next30.infrae.com/service_members/logout If I want to login
  immediately (noticed a typo or as another user) it's not possible to
  login and you can try as many times as you like. This was really
  confusing and needs to change.

- When in a tab and you want to reload it (just to be sure it's up to
  date) you go to the selected tab, hover, your cursor turns to a
  pointer so it's obviously a link, you click, and nothing
  happens. However sometimes, when in a subscreen like "View previous
  version", the link does work and it's the only way to get back to
  the main screen. Best would be if the link always worked. Second
  best is that the tab ceases to be a link when selected, but then you
  have to go to another tab and back to get a reload.

DONE - The form headings (h4 with '.form-content h4') such as "Publish
  new version" and "Manual close" need more margin-left to match the
  labels and h3 "Publication" indent.

- When a field is focused it gets a green background. You can also
  focus a field just by clicking near it in the background of the
  containing box. But onblur, if you click outside of the form, the
  background stays green as though its focused. Can you make the
  background return to gray onblur? However, when a field has an
  error, the pink background should not disappear.



Logged in as Author
===================

- When logged in as Author at
  http://next30.infrae.com/edit#content!products all of the optioned
  buttons for documents in the listing only have Goto, Preview, and
  Properties. Publish is missing.

Publish screen of docs
----------------------
DONE - In the "Manage versions" table, all the headings will fit on one line if we change them to:
# 	Modification 	Publication 	Expiration 	Author 	Status
We can safely change 'Version' to '#', which prevents wasting space in those cells, because the table title is "Manage versions".

DONE - If we wish we can remove the spacetime from the "Modification
  time Publication time Expiration time" table headings. It's obvious
  the values are times. Ha ha ha, if we wish we can remove the ' time'.


???? - The "Request approval" button should read "Request approval".

- If an Editor wrote a message with the rejection of approval it
  doesn't appear for the Author to read.

Publication time

- BTW, when the submit fails, the feedback says "Missing year value."
  but the cursor is in the day field. The UI doesn't indicate which
  field is which, but day/month/year is normal for all of our
  customers, even the Americans (who think it's chic).

- If your window is not large the feedback obscures the minute field
  and the calendar, so you can't click the calendar to set the
  date. Can we locate the feedback higher, to the right of the field
  label?

- Strangely, if I enter '11' into the year field as an Author, the
  value is accepted and becomes 2011. This fails when an Editor
  publishes.

- It's confusing when an Author submits the request for approval. The
  screen comes back instantly with the cursor focused in the "add
  message on withdrawal" textarea. At first I thought it was required
  to add a message to my request. (I looked away and didn't catch the
  "Approval requested" feedback.) That field is not required, is it
  just focusing automatically because it's the first one?

Message

- The text area (this and all the others) has a fixed width and is
  often too long. Granted, in Safari and recent FF you can scale it
  yourself. A max-width that is 20px less than its parent should work.

- The "Request appoval", "Withdraw approval request", "Reject approval
  request", and probably more button/links don't have a title
  attribute. Check an older Silva for the attribute content.

Publish screen of docs
----------------------

- When an Editor goes to the Publish screen of a doc that's been
  submitted for approval, it's not really obvious that the doc is
  waiting for approval. The only indication is there's both a "Publish
  Now" and "Reject Request" button (looking good together). Not sure
  if we should do something more.

- If an Author wrote a message with the request for approval it
  doesn't appear for the Editor to read.
