Silva 3.0 test notes
====================

DONE signal

DONE - "Informations" should be "Information".

When something's done I'll test it and, assuming a positive result, delete it from this list.


General comments
----------------

NOTHING TO DO ? - New feedback colors are much more noticeable.

- Changing languages does not change the UI. The user must reload. Can
  we do that for the user?

Import screen
-------------

Export screen
-------------

Contents screen
---------------

DONE - "Content moved in position 15" -> "Content moved to position 15."

DONE - When I select a doc and perform an action such as Publish or New
  Version, it moves up. Bizarre.

Access screen
-------------

- You can remove your own role, and then you're locked out. :-) This
  wasn't possible before.

- If you get locked out, you get a model password prompt in the SMI. I
  could not login with this. I had to reload, which took me back to
  the home page with the nested login form, and then I could
  login. This is real glitch that could frustrate a user.

Settings screen of folder
-------------------------

- When changing a folder to a publication, after I click the convert
  button, I get feedback but nothing happens. The sidebar doesn't
  change and the icon in the header is still a folder icon. I have to
  reload to see the changes.

Publish screen of docs, logged in as Author
-------------------------------------------

DON'T SEE IT - The text "A message nobody will read." should be like
  the dates and disappear when the field focuses.

Publish screen of docs, logged in as ChiefEditor
------------------------------------------------

THERE UNITTEST AT LEAST FOR THAT + To test: Is the publishing workflow
  email working?

Functional fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Datetime fields

Publication time

THE FIELD IS ACTUALLY REVELENT LIKE WE DISSCUSSED, IF YOU WANT TO
  PUBLISH IN THE PAST OR SET AN EXPIRATION DATE - The "Publish now"
  action fails if there is a bad date in the "Publication time"
  field. This is wrong because the Publication time is now, not the
  field value. Several minutes could have passed, so the system
  datetime should be used. The field value is irrelevant.

- Manually filling in 28-8-11 causes an error (on the 11). The server
  should interpret the 11 as 2011. Only happens for Editors, for
  Authors the year is correctly interpreted. Should be easy to
  fix. Then we can probably ignore the following:

- Wrong feedback after internal system error. To reproduce, go to a
  document and fill in a year of '11'. Click "Publish now". You'll
  get the "An internal error happened" alert. Click "Continue". Then
  click a folder in the sidebar. Feedback appears, saying "Version
  published".

Notes since changing the fields

- If I remove the year completely, the whole row goes pink and I get
  validation feedback "Missing year value.". However if I fill in
  '11', the only feedback is the pink glowing border, and I can still
  submit and the error described above.

- Why can Authors successfully submit a year of '11' but not Editors?
  The '11' gets correctly interpreted en Authors submit, but Editors
  get a system error. Can you make it interpret correctly for Editors
  too? Saves 2 chars.

Expiration time

- When a doc has been published with an expiration date, that date
  must be prefilled when editing/publishing the doc again. Now the
  field is empty and the exp date gets removed on next publication.

- It used to be possible to change the future dates when a doc was
  approved for the future with an "Update timings" button. We can
  leave that out if it's complicated, but that made the approved for
  future state completely clear. Plus easy to edit. As it is now you
  need to revoke and then approve again.

Manage versions

- Please make the version status text a link to view it. Now we're
  adding a click, by making users first select a checkbox, then click
  "View".

- Delete: When selecting items for deletion, the form remains sticky
  with selections after deletion, e.g. if you delete versions 2 and 3,
  the form comes back with items 0 and 1 selected.

- Delete: We don't ask, "Are you sure?" on the delete action. Should we?

DONE - View: viewing an old version shows it as default html. It should be
  wrapped in layout like preview.

- View: when viewing an old version the "Publish now" button in the
  header should not appear, as you're not publishing the version
  you're viewing. Change it to a "Return" button?

DONE - Compare: doesn't compare.

DONE - If there are batched versions and you go to the second screen,
  clicking the New version or Publish button in the header 404s.


Properties screen
-----------------

hide from tables of content

- The hide from tables of content field absolutely does not belong in
  Properties. It should be in Settings. We should change this now as
  part of the content upgrade.

- This screen really needs interaction design. I'm going to see if
  Gert has an afternoon.

Subscriptions screen
--------------------

DONE + Errors when enabling subscriptions


Image
=====

- When adding an image the UI has two controls for the capsule, a checkbox
  for if you want it, and a text string field for the content. Let's reduce
  this to only the string field. We won't automatically fill it (like we do
  the alt parameter). If the field has content, the caption gets rendered,
  otherwise it gets skipped when rendering.

Image sidebar
-------------

- In the the edit tab the "edit content" icon for docs in References
  is not found.

- If an image is cropped, the thumbnail has incorrect proportions in
  the html. If the image is 804x465 pixels scaled to 142x120 pixels,
  the img tag has attributes width="120" height="101". These
  proportions match the crop, but the thumbnail displays the original
  image, and should have the same proportions.

Link
====

target of relative link

DONE - Change "no reference selected" to "Click the Lookup button to
  select a reference."

- Change to "Click the Lookup button to select an item to refer to."
  (This is not good form "a content", the word content is treated as
  a plural form. Not sure why....)


Add forms
=========

- The generic id and title field are too short. The id can't hold more
  than:'new_directions_in_econi'. This is way too short for our
  clients. Those firlds should have a size that matches the
  textareas. For now make them bigger, like size="40".

Ghost, Ghost Folder, Link

- Change "no reference selected" to "Click the Lookup button to select
  a reference. "

Silva News Filter

- Title field(s) are too short. Make them size="40".

- The "montrer les éléments d'agenda" checkbox with no label looks
  lost. Can we always put a 'Yes" label next to these?


Metadata system
===============

+ It's not possible to make a metadata set editable. It 404s.

+ It's not possible to add a field to a metadata set. It 404s.


UI/usability fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Submit buttons and reporting

- When a doc is approved for the future, you can't see that it is
  approved for the future. The only indication is the "Publish Now"
  button changes to "Revoke Approval". No information about the future
  date of publication is visible. You only see "Manage versions". It's
  especially confusing if a doc is already published, then you see
  "Manaal close" and a "x Close published version" button, but nothing
  about the approval:
  (http://next30.infrae.com/edit#publish!products/lxml). We can
  display the future approval date in the "Information", but I'd
  rather see it in the form body itself because that's where users
  will be looking.

Manual close

- Under "Manual close", the hint should have the same font-style as
  the field hints. The selector is '.form-head p'. Currently hints are
  in italic (which should change because it doesn't make sense, but
  let's first be consistent).

- Vertical space under "Manual close" between hint and button needs to
  collapse and match the spacing between hints and fields.


Manage versions

- Personally I miss the link colors for Unapproved, Published, and
  Last closed. They made it so clear and you could instantly see what
  was what. Now you have to read each one. We do have room to put
  colored balls next to the version number but they won't look good.

- View: when viewing an old version there's no obvious way to get back
  the publish screen. We can let people learn to click on the already
  selected tab, but that's not obvious.

(BROWSER->DUTCH) Date rendering and interpretation



More Notes (27-28 aug and later)
================================

- The "Settings" tab at the top of the screen should be an optioned
  button like the "Content" tab. If you click Settings, you go to
  Settings. If you click the down arrow, you see the options: Access,
  Addables, Customization, etc.

- Logout and in: after clicking the logout button the browser goes to:
  http://next30.infrae.com/service_members/logout If I want to login
  immediately (noticed a typo or as another user) it's not possible to
  login and you can try as many times as you like. This was really
  confusing and needs to change.

- When in a tab and you want to reload it (just to be sure it's up to
  date) you go to the selected tab, hover, your cursor turns to a
  pointer so it's obviously a link, you click, and nothing
  happens. However sometimes, when in a subscreen like "View previous
  version", the link does work and it's the only way to get back to
  the main screen. Best would be if the link always worked. Second
  best is that the tab ceases to be a link when selected, but then you
  have to go to another tab and back to get a reload.

DONE - The form headings (h4 with '.form-content h4') such as "Publish
  new version" and "Manual close" need more margin-left to match the
  labels and h3 "Publication" indent.

NOPE - When a field is focused it gets a green background. You can also
  focus a field just by clicking near it in the background of the
  containing box. But onblur, if you click outside of the form, the
  background stays green as though its focused. Can you make the
  background return to gray onblur? However, when a field has an
  error, the pink background should not disappear.



Logged in as Author
===================

DONE - When logged in as Author at
  http://next30.infrae.com/edit#content!products all of the optioned
  buttons for documents in the listing only have Goto, Preview, and
  Properties. Publish is missing.

Publish screen of docs
----------------------

Publication time

YOU CAN CLICK ON THE FEEDBACK TO MAKE IT DISAPPEAR - If your window is
  not large the feedback obscures the minute field and the calendar,
  so you can't click the calendar to set the date. Can we locate the
  feedback higher, to the right of the field label?

I HAVE TO EXPLAIN THAT ONE - Strangely, if I enter '11' into the year
  field as an Author, the value is accepted and becomes 2011. This
  fails when an Editor publishes.

Message

- The text area (this and all the others) has a fixed width and is
  often too long. Granted, in Safari and recent FF you can scale it
  yourself. A max-width that is 20px less than its parent should work.

THEY DIDN'T HAVE IN THE OLD ONE EITHER. PLEASE PROPOSE TITLES - The
  "Request appoval", "Withdraw approval request", "Reject approval
  request", and probably more button/links don't have a title
  attribute. Check an older Silva for the attribute content.


Logged in as ChiefEditor
========================

Publish screen of docs
----------------------

- When an Editor goes to the Publish screen of a doc that's been
  submitted for approval, it's not really obvious that the doc is
  waiting for approval. The only indication is there's both a "Publish
  Now" and "Reject Request" button (looking good together). Not sure
  if we should do something more.


SNN
===

A LOCATION IS ALWAYS ASSOCIATED TO A DATE WHERE THE EVENT HAPPENS
  (valentim specs). - When creating an Agenda Item it's not possible
  to add a location without filling out all the datetimes. Shouldn't
  that be a separate field?

- The month field lets me fill in '19'. Can the inline validation do a
  range check like it does in publish?

- After submitting the above entry, the entire multi-field goes pink,
  and I have no idea which of the seven fields contains the error. We
  need to figure out something here. Don't we know what the invalid
  entry is?

THAT SHOULD WORK NOW - The Agenda Item I made wouldn't save. Got a
  message that the server is down. next30.infrae.com is
  crawling. Giving up for now. Uren works fine.  Things seem to speed
  up so I came back and tried saving again. No dice.


Editor
======
- The source view has light gray text and is hard to read.
