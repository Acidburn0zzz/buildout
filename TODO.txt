===========================
List of known bugs - issues
===========================

This is a list of points that need attention before final release.

Important issues
================

Editor
------

- Code source and image selection and dragging around should be fixed
  in IE, Chrome, Safari. It only works on Firefox. Those elements are
  inline-block. Selection behave like block selection in Firefox, and
  like inline selection in other browsers. This should be somehow
  fixed.

- When all the editor issues are resolved, test all code sources (from
  a user perspective).

- Code source error reporting.

Silva core
----------

- File that are inside Image content should not be indexed (they
  should not trigger any event, maybe adding a suppress_event).

- If you create a Ghost Folder from a Folder, you cannot no longer
  delete anything from the source Folder. You should be able to, and
  that should delete the linked content in the Ghost Folder too.

- Javscript folder view (re order, filter out elements).

API
---

- silva_walk_tree require issue (is not passed when it recurse, in
  silva.core.services).

Forms
-----

- update inline validation to work with nested form widget.

- the file upload widget must tested in low latency networks. For the
  moment it does work.


Extensions
----------

- Test and update silva.pas.openid.

- test and update the global search and replace.

Merging
=======

2.1
---

- verify logging form changes (redirect to path option).

2.3
---

NEED TESTING - file convertion (keep metadata and references, include refactor part
  of the code made in SilvaDocument for the

NEED TESTING - upgrade event.


Tests
=====

These points need extra testing:

- get_introduction document

- formulator adapter / interfacefield / emaillinesfield.

Packaging
=========

- make a buildout recipe with the fix_headers script. Add an option to
  detect missing headers, and add them. Verify that the LICENSE.txt is
  in the package, add if missing.

- minimise resources (JS, CSS).  Verify MANIFEST.in (run egg_info,
  check that sources.txt contains all required files).

Low importance issues
=====================

Editor
------

- Code source parameter form is not usuable as the pop-up height passes
  the screen height on small screens. We need to figure out something
  here.

- Not able to add CS's with lots of fields. On a screen height of
  800px you can't see, and use the form actions in the popup for
  adding a CS. There is a scrollbar but it doesn't scroll to the end
  of all fields.


Listing
-------

- keyboard shortcut change publishable<->asset.

- prevent repeat on keys (ctrl-c).

- if you delete all elements of a container, a line this container is empty
  should be added.

- if you filter out all elements of a container, a line no content
  match your filter criteria should be added.

- improve jstree reloading. at the moment it is impossible to reload
  only an entry of the tree without changing its parent and all
  children.

Other
-----

- Formulator datetime widget using jQuery.

- Check for newlines in HTTP headers in infrae.wsgi.

==============================================================================

Those points need review, testing and description.

UI
==

?? - settings addable on install

- form change notification

- last author don't change on publication actions

UI / JS
=======

- on Zope restart invalidation is out of sync

- filter fix while adding

Document
========

- code source error on preview and public rendering [kit]

Code sources
============

- feedback on install / service: error explanation.

News
====

- Agenda recurrence widget fix
  (Some part still doesn't seems to work, select days and days in a month)

- XML import export

- Install Products.SilvaNews at the beginning the upgrade / remove it after.

Other
=====

- subscription breaks everything ??

- smi layout for download error

- ghost cataloging when haunted change / tests

- Change upgrade to apply all the upgrader after each other on every
  object instead of doing upgrader on every object after each
  other. Add the concept of delayed upgrader that are executed by
  order of version only after the upgrade process. Update index and
  uninstall of Products.SilvaNews and Products.SilvaDocuments are
  example of such things.


TODO Clean
==========

- silva.core.messages should use a datamanager to cancel any messages
  on transaction.abort().

- an option should be added to silva.core.references to be able to
  select an index in the reference lookup widget. This option should
  be made available to the Formulator widget.

- SMI: Form: template for object (used with collections), should be
  reviewed, including the display template. Silva Agenda Item edit
  form is an example.

- SMI: Silva Image edit form contains an thubnail image, a link to the
  preview should be used. We can modify the tag method to take two
  more options: request and options. The URL should be obtained using
  the IContentURL adapter.

- test infrae.wsgi virtual hosting.

- SQLSource rendering is broken.

- add forms in reference lookup widgets are broken. form JS
  initialization is done correctly.
