===========================
List of known bugs - issues
===========================

This is a list of points that need attention before final release.

Important issues
================

Editor
------

- The icon sprite used in the editor skin contains transparent
  icons. They should be replaced with not transparent one (using the
  transparent color is ok, but not semi transparent one). Base icon
  set would be yumyum.

- Update CKEditor, to support iPad (need a new verison of js.ckeditor
  to be made on bitbutcket).

- Code source and image selection and dragging around should be fixed
  in IE, Chrome, Safari. It only works on Firefox. Those elements are
  inline-block. Selection behave like block selection in Firefox, and
  like inline selection in other browsers. This should be somehow
  fixed.

- An option should be added in the service_editor in order to ban the
  use of colors in the text editor (think about the table background,
  foreground and border colors).

- When all the editor issues are resolved, test all code sources (form
  a user perspective).

Silva core
----------

- Catalog indexing should be tested and fixed. Each action requiring a
  reindexing of the object, should reindex all the object, as some
  indexes used other index values (like fulltext). Fulltext should be
  defined as its own interface.

  This can be effeciently fixed, by collecting which content to
  reindex during the action phase of the request, and reindexing them
  at the end of this action (thread local, or request annotation).

- File that are inside Image content should not be indexed (they
  should not trigger any event, maybe adding a suppress_event).

- If you create a Ghost Folder from a Folder, you cannot no longer
  delete anything from the source Folder. You should be able to, and
  that should delete the linked content in the Ghost Folder too.

- Content order is not correct in some container events (rename is
  one). This is due to the fact that is considered as it is removed
  and added back after. During those operation, the order should
  remain the same. This need testing.

- If you upload a new File in an existing one, the content_type,
  content_encoding and such are not properly updated. This need
  testing.

- SQL source is broken in SilvaExternalSources (not addable).

- Update ODT export.


API
---

- silva_walk_tree require issue (is not passed when it recurse, in
  silva.core.services).

- in Silva, versioning.py, get_viewable and similar methods should do
  _getOb(version_id, None), in case of inconsistent document. In case
  of inconsistent document it should issued an error in the logs.

Forms
-----

- The image thumbnail displayed on the edit form should not have cache
  headers.

Extensions
----------

- Test and update silva.pas.openid.

Merging
=======

2.1
---

- silva news local datetime option.

- verify logging form changes (redirect to path option).

2.3
---

- file convertion (keep metadata and references, include refactor part
  of the code made in SilvaDocument for the migration).

- file mimetype changes.

- upgrade event.


Tests
=====

This points need extra testing:

- get_introduction document

- formulator adapter / interfacefield / emaillinesfield.

Packaging
=========

- i18nextract should create a launchpad tarball following the
  launchpad structure. It should be able to extract a launchpad
  tarball in a regular gettext translation structure too.

  -> Update translation on launchpad after this.

- minimise resources

Low importance issues
=====================

Editor
------

- Code source parameter form is not usuable on small screens. We need
  to figure out something here.

Forms
-----

- update inline validation to work with nested form widget.

- the file upload widget must tested in low latency networks. For the
  moment it does work.

- the middleware used by the file upload widget should not intercept
  all file upload (test with the SilvaSoftwareCenter).

Listing
-------

- keyboard shortcut change publishable<->asset.

- prevent repeat on keys (ctrl-c).

- if you delete all elements of a container, a line this container is empty
  should be added.

- if you filter out all elements of a container, a line no content
  match your filter criteria should be added.

- improve jstree reloading. at the moment it is impossible to reload
  only an entry of the tree without changing its parent and all
  children.

Other
-----

- Formulator datetime widget using jQuery.

- Check for newlines in HTTP headers in infrae.wsgi.

==============================================================================

Those points need review, testing and description.

  of all fields.
