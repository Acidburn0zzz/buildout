You can upgrade an Silva 1.6 buildout tree to a higher version :

0. Stop all zope instance.

    svn switch https://svn.infrae.com/buildout/silva/tag/Silva-2.0


   You can switch to the trunk version also.

    python2.4 bootstrap/bootstrap.py
  
   Attention : all files in the part directory will be cleaned, before to be upgraded. Data.fs (in the var directory) will remain intact.

    ./bin/buildout
